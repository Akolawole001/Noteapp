This is my student's repo, I cloned it locally from his github. I asked him to make a calculator that works in terminal and he did it. Then I asked him to build a note taking app that also has a calendar and to do list. He did it too but also did everything in this 1 repo and didn't do it in a new repo or understand why we always have multiple repos for multiple projects or 1 project with multiple microservices or ends.

I'm meant to review his note taking app, the mistakes end to end and give him feedback on how to improve his AI assisted coding skills.

So you'll help me review what he's done and offer guidance on how to build next time a better project structure, better separation of concerns, better separation of repo where needed, better code practices, better use of AI tools to help him build better software.

Also educate him on what he's done, especially API and why API. Just to take his learning forward. Keep it simple and easy to understand than too technical. This is just a guy learning coding with AI and not a traditional CS student. I;ve built production apps with AI too without CS background so I get where he's coming from.

See files ffff.md and architecture_reasoning.md for context on how I always teach him.

Use well formatted .txt file for your review than markdown so he can read it easily in any text editor without formatting issues.

Remember this is about his noteapp. Although I see somethings meant for the note app showing outside the folder like the db. Just end the reveiw with how to do this in production way. Just principles that can aid building any other app in future. Not too limited to noteapp.

- Other areas of improvement I noticed that needs to be in the review note:
css and javascript in same html file
- .env file with secrets in repo
- wrong use of git ignore
- backend and frontend mixed together in one repo
- wrong use of docker (sometimes we don't need it if we're deploying to static server directly or even mananged cloud services like vercel, netlify, GCP, AWS etc)

Overall, this is a great start for a demo project and learning experience. Even though its not production grade yet.

Remember, we're writing about the noteapp specifically and not the calculator. The calculator was just a warm up project.
